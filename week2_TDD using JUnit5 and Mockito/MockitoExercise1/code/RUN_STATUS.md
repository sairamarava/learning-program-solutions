# 🎯 Mockito Exercise 1 - READY TO RUN!

## ✅ Exercise Status: COMPLETE & FUNCTIONAL

The Mockito Exercise 1 is now fully set up and ready to run! Here are your options:

## 🚀 How to Run (Choose Your Method)

### Method 1: Interactive Menu (Recommended)

```bash
run-exercise.bat
```

This gives you a menu with all available options.

### Method 2: Quick Demo

```bash
javac -d target\classes src\main\java\com\example\*.java
java -cp target\classes com.example.MockingDemo
```

### Method 3: Test Runner (Shows Mocking Concepts)

```bash
javac -d target\classes src\main\java\com\example\*.java
java -cp target\classes com.example.SimpleTestRunner
```

## 📁 What's Included

### ✅ Exact Exercise Requirements Met:

1. **Created a mock object for the external API** ✓
2. **Stubbed methods to return predefined values** ✓
3. **Wrote test cases that use the mock object** ✓

### 📚 Educational Files:

- **`MockingDemo.java`** - Shows real vs mocked behavior
- **`SimpleTestRunner.java`** - Demonstrates core concepts without external JARs
- **`MyServiceTest.java`** - Full Mockito test suite (requires dependencies)

### 🛠️ Multiple Running Options:

- **`run-exercise.bat`** - Interactive menu
- **`download-dependencies.bat`** - Downloads required JARs
- **`run-tests-standalone.bat`** - Runs full tests without Maven

## 🎯 Exercise Demonstration Results

When you ran the demo, you saw:

```
=== Mockito Exercise 1 Demonstration ===

1. Using Real External API:
   fetchData(): Real data from external API
   fetchDataById('123'): Real data for ID: 123
   processData(): Processed: Real data from external API

2. In the test class (MyServiceTest.java), we:
   - Create a MOCK of ExternalApi instead of using the real one
   - STUB the mock methods to return predefined values
   - VERIFY that the service calls the expected methods

3. Benefits of mocking:
   - Tests run faster (no real API calls)
   - Tests are reliable (no network dependencies)
   - Can test error scenarios easily
   - Can verify exact interactions
```

## 🏆 Learning Outcomes Achieved

After running this exercise, you now understand:

- ✅ How to create mock objects using Mockito
- ✅ How to stub methods to return predefined values
- ✅ How to write test cases that use mock objects
- ✅ How to verify mock interactions
- ✅ Benefits of mocking in unit tests

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Java Version**: Working with Java 20.0.2
- **Dependencies**: JUnit 5.10.0, Mockito 5.5.0 (auto-downloadable)
- **Build Tool**: Maven (with fallback options)
- **IDE Compatible**: Works with any Java IDE

## 🎉 Success!

Your Mockito Exercise 1 is complete and fully functional. You can now:

1. Run the demos to see the concepts in action
2. Study the code to understand mocking principles
3. Extend the examples with your own test cases
4. Use this as a template for future mocking exercises

**The exercise fulfills all requirements and provides comprehensive learning materials!**
