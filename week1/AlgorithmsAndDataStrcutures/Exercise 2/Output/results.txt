ðŸ“Œ Recursive Financial Forecasting Analysis

1. What is Recursion?
   - A technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller sub-problems.
   - Ideal for problems with repeated structures like compound interest or tree traversal.

2. Recursive Algorithm Used:
   forecastValue(P, r, n) = forecastValue(P * (1 + r), r, n - 1)
   Base case: n == 0

3. Time Complexity:
   - T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1)
   - Total Time: O(n)
   - Stack Space: O(n) due to recursive calls

4. Optimization:
   - Use iteration (loop-based approach) to avoid call stack overflow.
   - This is especially necessary for large values of n (e.g., n > 1000).
   - Iterative approach: O(n) time, O(1) space.

5. Conclusion:
   - Recursion simplifies logic but has memory overhead.
   - For large-scale forecasting, prefer iteration or dynamic programming.
