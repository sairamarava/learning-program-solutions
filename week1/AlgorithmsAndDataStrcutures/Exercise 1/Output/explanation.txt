Linear Search is simple but slow for large datasets with time complexity of O(n)
Binary Search is faster (O(log n)) but requires "sorted data".
Use Binary Search when product data is sorted. For real-world systems, indexing or using databases with search optimization (like Elasticsearch) is preferred.
