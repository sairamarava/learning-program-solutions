ðŸ“Œ Employee Management System â€“ Array Analysis

1. Array Representation:
   - Arrays are contiguous memory blocks.
   - Each element is accessed via its index in constant time.
   - Useful for fixed-size datasets and fast indexed access.

2. Time Complexity:
   - Add (at end): O(1)
   - Search (linear): O(n)
   - Traverse: O(n)
   - Delete (by shifting): O(n)

3. Limitations of Arrays:
   - Fixed size: Cannot dynamically grow.
   - Insertion and Deletion at arbitrary positions are costly (O(n)).
   - Inefficient for large-scale dynamic data where frequent resizing or updates are needed.

4. When to Use Arrays:
   - When data size is known and fixed.
   - When fast indexed access is critical.
   - When memory is tightly managed (embedded systems).

âœ… Suggestion:
For more dynamic and scalable systems, consider using ArrayList or HashMap.
